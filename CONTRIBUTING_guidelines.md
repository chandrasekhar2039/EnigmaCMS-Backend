Thank you for taking the time to contribute to one of Enigma's Open source projects! 🔥 🦊 <3 🤖! 🎉 👍 For a full list of projects go through the repositories under the organization.

Before contributing, please review our guidelines given below.

We welcome all types of contributions, including, but not limited to:
* Filing issues
* Translating our apps
* User experience design
* Writing documentation
* Testing the app
* Writing code

Have another idea for how you can contribute? Let us know!

### Communication
For each our projects, we communicate on the discord server:
- Join the discord server [here](https://www.google.com/)
- *We're available Monday-Saturday
during IST working hours(9AM - 9PM).*

**Be sure to join the discord server** and don't be afraid to make postings of your
own! A link to each project-specific communication channel can be found inside
the discord server.

## Filing issues

We usually track our project's issues on GitHub (example: [place_holder](www.google.com)).
To file a bug:
* Find your project's issues: these will be linked from the project's README
or you can click directly into the issues from the project's home page
* Create a new issue!

To ensure we can understand, reproduce, and effectively triage your issues,
**please fill out the provided template** when filing an issue! When issues
are filed in a consistent style and include the information we need to
make decisions, we're more likely to take action on these issues than if
we don't understand them.

*Be sure to include any extra information you find valuable!* For example, posting
screenshots and GIFs can help us debug problems.


## User experience design

Get in touch with one of our designers (@placeholder)
or other core team members to get involved! With a limited number of people, we
can't implement every design so we want to make sure any design work you do will
make it into our products.

## Writing documentation

### Product support documentation
Each project requires an in-project content. If you wish to contribute, please contact a core team
member to get started. This thing will be tightly supervised by the core team. In case if you find a typo or grammatical error raise an issue for that.

### Developer/repository documentation
See an issue with our documentation, either in a project's repository or this
file? Please file an issue or create a pull request
to fix it yourself!

## Testing the project

* Fork and clone one of our projects and look for issues. 
* File [new issues](#filing-issues) for all bugs you encounter. Make sure that an
issue isn't filed already (via the search).
* Make sure that your bug report follows the provided template
* Try to reproduce issues reported by others and add additional or missing
information to the bug reports.

## Writing code

See [CONTRIBUTING_code.md](./CONTRIBUTING_code.md).
